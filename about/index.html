		I am an extremely organized individual with a significant management background and over ten years experience in
		phenomenal customer service. I have intermediate knowledge of Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Java. I am well-versed with both Windows and Mac operating systems, the Microsoft Office and Google Drive suites of office products. I possess the organizational ability, computer proficiency, and communication skills to be an excellent fit for any organization.

		My lengthy experience working in theater as a stage manager makes me an ideal candidate for working on projects with teams. Because it might not be apparent how the duties of a stage manager translate to those necessary to this work, Iâ€™ve described some of these duties in my resume. As a stage manager, I acted as the communication and organizational hub of many successful productions. I communicated effectively with the director, designers, actors, and crew in person and by email. I took detailed notes and created daily reports that I distributed to the director and designers. I scheduled auditions, rehearsals, meetings, and costume fittings. I was the singular point person for any problems that arose.

		After my work in theater, I spent 4 years as a stay-at-home mother. In 2019, when my son entered preschool, I decided
		to pursue my interest in computer programming.
