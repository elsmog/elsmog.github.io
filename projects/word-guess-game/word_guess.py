When the user plays WordGuess, the computer first selects a secret word at
random from a list. The program then prints out a row of dashesâ€” one for each
letter in the secret word and asks the user to guess a letter.

If the user guesses a letter that is in the word, the word is redisplayed with
all instances of that letter shown in the correct positions, along with any
letters correctly guessed on previous turns.

If the letter does not appear in the word, the user is charged with an
incorrect guess. The user keeps guessing letters until either (1) the user has
correctly guessed all the letters in the word or (2) the user has made eight
incorrect guesses.
